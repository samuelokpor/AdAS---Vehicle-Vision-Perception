## YOLOv5 Object Detection with Bird's Eye View and Tracking

This project utilizes the YOLOv5 deep learning model to perform real-time object detection for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). It provides a framework for detecting and tracking objects in the context of automotive safety and driver assistance applications. it provides a Bird's Eye View (BEV) visualization, which offers a top-down perspective of the detected objects.

### Features

- Real-time object detection using the YOLOv5 model.
- Detection of various objects relevant to ADAS, such as vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, and traffic signs.
- Object tracking to maintain continuity and trajectory of detected objects.
- Bird's Eye View (BEV) visualization of the detected objects in a simulated environment.
- Customizable confidence threshold and class filtering.
- Simulated environment provides an intuitive top-down view of object positions and movements.
- Supports both image and video input for object detection and tracking.
- Easy integration with pre-trained YOLOv5 models.
- Provides bounding box coordinates, class labels, and tracking IDs for detected objects.
